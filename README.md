# SempiternalSystem
A game programing practice.

This is a project that **NOT** worth your time to explore.

It is under devoloping now.

I will create a game with a basic framework and submit it as a homework.

## About the game

It is a 2D, or more exactly, 2.5D, game that enable player to plant, create, learn, trade, discover and so on.

In design it should include endless and random-genarated dungeon and artificial designed dungeon, which arranged event thread let player could enjoy in the story and do whatever they like.

It will be a RPG that give every player a unique experience. And enable player to visit the others' world. The internal console can be access via Telnet.

It should be boring afterall.
